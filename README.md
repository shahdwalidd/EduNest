# EduNest (Learn. Mentor. Grow.) — Project Documentation

## 1. Executive Summary & Overview
**EduNest** is a cutting-edge web platform engineered to bridge the gap between students and professional mentors/educators. Built using **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, the application offers a secure, highly scalable, and responsive ecosystem. 

The architecture features strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), custom-tailored dashboards for diverse user profiles, state-of-the-art build-time optimizations (such as manual chunk splitting and asset optimization), and seamless real-time data streaming.

## 3. Application Architecture & Routing (RBAC)

The application handles routing dynamically via `src/App.tsx`. To optimize performance, asynchronous resource loading is achieved using **Code-Splitting** (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`). Secure routes are wrapped in a robust `ProtectedRoute` guard ensuring strict role separation.

### A. Public Routes (Accessible to all guests)
*   **Core Pages:** `/` (Home), `/become-mentor`, `/start-Started`
*   **Mentorship Catalog:** `/mentorships`, `/mentorships/:mentorshipId` (Sub-routes: `overview`, `content`, `reviews`, `leaderboard`)
*   **Profiles:** `/mentor-profile/:mentorEmail`
*   **Authentication & Onboarding:** `/login`, `/register`, `/verify`, `/success`
*   **Account Recovery Flows:** 
    *   `/forgot-password`, `/check-email`, `/reset-password`, `/reset-success`
    *   `/restore-account`, `/confirm-restore`

### B. Protected Role-Based Routes
├── ROLE_MENTOR (Mentor Workspace)
│   ├── /mentor/dashboard — Analytics, active student metrics, overview
│   ├── /mentor/mentorships — Manage programs, create, edit, delete
│   ├── /mentor/operations — Orchestrate live sessions, quizzes, tasks, and projects
│   └── /mentor/messages, /mentor/notifications, /mentor/profile, /mentor/settings
│
├── ROLE_STUDENT (Student Learning Space)
│   ├── /student/dashboard — Enrolled courses tracking, progress tracking
│   ├── /explore-mentorships — Discovery engine for programs
│   ├── /student/learning / /student/learning/:mentorshipId/... — Interactive course viewer
│   ├── /mentorships/:mentorshipId/enroll — Checkout and enrollment gate
│   └── /student/messages, /student/notifications, /student/profile, /student/settings
│
└── ROLE_ADMIN (Global Control Panel)
└── /admin/dashboard (AdminLayout containing: dashboard, payment, issues, configurations, users)

## 4. Application Context & Global Providers
The root setup (`src/main.tsx`) bootstraps the global data layers by securely nesting providers to supply cross-cutting concerns:

*   **`ThemeProvider`**: Powers the universal light/dark mode configuration.
*   **`WebSocketProvider`**: Manages persistent full-duplex socket links for live notifications.
*   **`NotificationsProvider`**: Handles event listener propagation for real-time application signals.
*   **`CustomToaster`** (`src/components/common/toaster/CustomToaster.tsx`): Renders highly customized UI feedback toasts.

## 5. Performance, Build, & SEO Optimizations

The application is thoroughly configured inside `vite.config.ts` to maximize production delivery efficiency and fulfill core Web Vitals.

### Code Splitting & Vendor Chunking
To prevent bloated bundle sizes, `manualChunks` divides the distribution code into specialized operational slices:
```typescript
manualChunks(id) {
  if (id.includes('node_modules')) {
    if (id.includes('react')) return 'vendor-react';
    if (id.includes('charts')) return 'vendor-charts';
    if (id.includes('icons')) return 'vendor-icons';
    if (id.includes('@jitsi')) return 'vendor-jitsi';
    if (id.includes('alert') || id.includes('toast')) return 'vendor-alerts';
    return 'vendor-misc';
  }
}
Asset Processing: cssCodeSplit: true ensures style sheets load conditionally alongside their respective page modules.

Compilation Strategy: minify: 'esbuild' guarantees ultra-fast build execution and minification.

Automated Asset Optimization
Using vite-plugin-image-optimizer, rich media resources undergo automated compression with zero runtime performance impact:

PNG / JPEG: Compressed to a strict 75% quality index.

WebP / AVIF: Transcoded and compressed to a strict 70% quality index.

Local Development Proxying
To circumvent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) limits during local engineering cycles, asynchronous traffic targeting /api maps to: http://localhost:8080.

SEO & Accessibility (a11y)
Crawling Controls: Deployed a standardized public/robots.txt configuration to manage automated search engine indexing layout.

Semantic UI: Enforced robust aria-label definitions across all interactive button groups and asset iconography.

6. Deep Dive Feature Focus: Explore Mentorships
The mentorship discovery portal (EXPLORE_MENTORSHIPS_FEATURE.md) provides a fluid, desktop-grade lookup interface.

Feature Mechanics
Asynchronous Debouncing: Text queries use a custom 500ms debounce window to eliminate repetitive REST inquiries.

Multi-Tier Filtering Matrix: Supports dynamic combined queries (Keyword lookup, Category classifications, Minimum/Maximum Price tracking, and Instant Reset actions).

State-Aware Pagination: Renders clear state bounds (start/end) alongside dynamic page-count tags.

Predictive UI/UX States: Contains structural layout loading skeletons, fail-safe HTTP error handling components, and expressive empty state prompts.

URL State Synchronization: Automatically serializes current searches, filters, and pages straight into the URL bar, empowering users to bookmark and share query configurations.

API Integration Specifics
Endpoint: GET /api/v1/mentorship/explore

Supported Query Parameters:

Markdown
?page=0&size=10&keyword=typescript&category=development&minPrice=10&maxPrice=150
7. Authentication & State Architecture
EduNest manages security tokens and cryptographic states via an integrated local-to-cloud security mapping pipeline detailed in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md.
